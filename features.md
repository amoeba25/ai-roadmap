```cd ai-learning-map```

3. Install dependencies <br>
    <code>
    npm install
    or 
    yarn install
    </code>

4. Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add your environment variables (for example): <br>
   ``` OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here```

5. Run the development server <br>
    <code>

### Simple features

- Topic Input and Generation : simple textbox where any topic can be entered and a simple roadmap
can be generated. 
- AI powered roadmap generation : the app will use an LLM to breakdown a topic into key learning areas and
subtopics
- Interactive visualization : using a flowgraph interface where nodes are connected visually and users can click/hover/expand 
the nodes. 
- Saving user's roadmaps : the roadmaps that the user's have created in the past can be stored in their local storage, so 
that they can access their previous roadmaps
    <pre>
    User enters topic → Call LLM API → Render roadmap → Save JSON in localStorage
            ↑                                                ↓
            └──────── Load from localStorage if exists ──────┘
    </pre>




### Extended features:
- Node expansion : a node can be clicked and expanded to get a deeper subtopic
- Learning level filter : dropdown or buttons for beginner / intermediate / advanced
- Export: export the roadmap to a JSON file
